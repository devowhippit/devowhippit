I'm a multi-disciplinary designer who has always been interested in the power of design to address complex social challenges. I use my experience to contribute to **open source** and **equity**. My enthusiasm for this work continues to grow over time. Currently, I'm working at [@CodeForAmerica](https://github.com/codeforamerica), helping build human-centered technology for the public. Previously, at the [@CityOfNewYork](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork) with [@NYCOpportunity](https://github.com/NYCOpportunity) I had the opportunity to contribute, release, and maintain [13+ open-source projects](https://nycopportunity.github.io/loves-open-source/).
